/// Constrainted to Multi-Objective meta-problem
/**
 * Implements a meta-problem class that wraps some other constrained problems,
 * resulting in multi-objective problem.
 *
 * Three implementations of the constrained to multi-objective are available. For a problem with m constraints,
 * m+nobj objective functions, the first objectives functions are the original objective functions.
 * The first implementation is the constrained to multi-objective defined by Coello Coello. The
 * objectives defined from constraints includes number of violated constraints and objective functions.
 * The second implementation is the COMOGA multi-objective problem: a nobj+1 problem with the last
 * objective the sum of the violations of the constraints.
 * The third implementation is the same as the second one but splitting the sum of violations between equality
 * and inequality constraints, resulting in a total of nobj+2 objectives problem.
 *
 * Note: This constraints handling technique can only be used for <b>MINIMIZATION</b> problems.
